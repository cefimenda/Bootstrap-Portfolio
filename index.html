                            <p>Born and raised in Istanbul, Turkey, Cefi grew up in a family of entrepreneurs, observing what it takes to succeed day after day. Exposed to the ins and outs of the family business, Cefi found himself providing insights in discussions and reading through legal deals at a very young age. His obsessively logical nature meant that he could easily identify logical discrepencies and offer solutions to inefficient processes. </p>
                            <p>While still at highschool, Cefi attended a Stanford Education Program for Gifted Youth where he pointed out an inconsistency during a quantum eraser experiment, thus debunking one of the interpretations of Quantum Mechanics. After the program, the professor made changes to his regular Quantum Physics course at Stanford University based on Cefi's insights on the experiment.</p>
                            <p>Cefi Menda is an entrepreneur with relentless energy, a truly unique per­spective, and insatiable hunger for knowledge. In order to follow a liberal arts path, Cefi enrolled in Duke University, where his curiosity manifested itself as he went on to study physics, and minored in philosophy and finance, while also taking courses in many other areas supporting the needs of an entrepreneur including computer science, economics, psycholo­gy and linguistics. </p>
                            <p>Post graduation, Cefi immediately focused all his energy into his entrepre­neurial spirit and co-founded 3 businesses, managed the investment of $800,000 into a combination of bonds and startup businesses, while also progressing himself by taking Spanish classes and improving his under­standing of the German language. Cefi continued to glean his entrepreneurial quest by teaching himself javascript, css, html, the basics of swift and ruby, as well as discovering his hidden talents in project management. </p>
                            <p>Cefi believes that the company you keep and the team you build are the ulti­mate decision makers in your success. He has the unique ability to identify talent and combine them in a way that highlights their strengths. Cefi proved himself by managing and advising talented professionals in an efficient and productive manner, allowing startups to move forward while remaining agile. He is an inspirational leader who believes that the best way to get people working hard is to unify them with a resonant vision. </p>
